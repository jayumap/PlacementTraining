constructors are special members functions 
name should be same as class name
cannot initialize variable ysing virtual keyword
inheritance not applicable
cannot return value 
used to allocate memory space to program

need of cons:



3 types
default,parameterized,copy,null,assignment


newly added 'private'

mostly default and parameterized are used.
attributes shouldn't be pvt in constructors.

default constructor is called whenever class object is created;

copy constructors syntax:
class A{
A(){
    cout<<"default constructor";
}
//copy constructor
A(const A& a){
    cout<<"copy cons called"
}
};

int main(){
    A obj;//def cons called
    A a1 = obj; copy cons;
    A a2(obj); copy cons copy called;
}



destructor 
deletes the object of constructor and prints the value of destructor
