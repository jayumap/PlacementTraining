inheritance 
need of inheritance: reduce code writing multiple times 
reduce code redundancy

5 types of inheritance
single level
multilevel
hierarchical
hybrid
multiple

single level: 1 base and 1 child class (1 class and 1 student)
hierarchical: 1 base class and others are derived classes 
hybrid: combination of single, multiple, hierarchical inheritance
multilevel: sequential classes 
multiple: multiple base and 1 derived 


access specifiers:
private 
public
protected

syntax:
class Animal{
    public:
    void eat();
}
class Dog : Public Animal{
    void run();
    cout<<"";
}
int main(){
    Dog d1;
    d1.eat();
    d1.run();
}


encapsulation: binding of data in grp 
abstraction: display necessary details eg. ATM Machine
